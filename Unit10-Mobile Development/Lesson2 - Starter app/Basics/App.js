//This is the main entry point for your Expo app. It should mainly handle high-level app configuration and navigation. Keeping your screens separate improves readability and scalability.

/*
View - Basic container, similar to <div> in web.

Text - For displaying text.

TouchableOpacity - Touchable component for buttons.

Image - For displaying images.

SafeAreaView - Ensures content is within safe screen bounds on iOS.

Platform - Detects the platform (iOS or Android) for conditional styles or logic.

Custom Hooks - Reusable logic to keep components clean.

/* 
Practice: 
Practice Question: Limit Counter Range

Your task is to update the counter component so that:

The Decrement button cannot reduce the count below 0.

The Increment button cannot increase the count above 10.

The buttons should be disabled when the count reaches these limits.
